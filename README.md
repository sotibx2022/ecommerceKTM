It must have been quite challenging to code every day after working for 8 hours in non-technical duties however introducing ecommerceKTM, a fully mobile-responsive front-end project that demonstrates proficiency in React and Redux Toolkit. This project seamlessly integrates Google Firebase for robust backend connectivity, including user authorization services. As an administrator, you'll have the ability to manage product details and images, update slider images, handle order management by updating statuses, review and remove irrelevant feedback, and stay on top of messages received through the contact page. The interactive dashboard provides valuable insights through charts and graphs. Registered users can conveniently add items to their cart, which is securely stored in the database for future sessions. They can also place orders, update their personal information and profile picture, and leave reviews for products. The project showcases custom CSS, AI-generated images, and utilizes a comprehensive React icon library.
